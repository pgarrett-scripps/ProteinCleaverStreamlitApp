# Protein Cleaver ðŸ”ª

Protein Cleaver is a versatile tool for protein analysis and digestion. It offers a range of features to help users:

1. **Identify Cleavage Sites:** Protein Cleaver assists in locating cleavage sites within protein sequences.

2. **Generate and Filter Peptides:** Users can generate peptides and apply filters to refine the selection.

3. **View Protein Sequence Coverage:** Gain insights into the coverage of a protein sequence by the generated peptides.

4. **Search for Motifs:** Easily search for specific motifs within the resulting peptides.

Protein Cleaver is particularly valuable in understanding why certain peptides might go unnoticed in mass 
spectrometry experiments. Potential reasons include overly strict search parameters or the physical and chemical 
properties of the peptide. To investigate the latter, Protein Cleaver can create a list of peptides that are 
likely to be generated and identified from a given protein sequence, referred to as proteotypic peptides.

Moreover, if users are interested in specific motifs like phosphorylation sites or particular amino acid residues, 
Protein Cleaver can assist in generating a list of peptides that contain these motifs. It also provides a 
visualization of motif coverage across the protein sequence, aiding in comprehensive analysis.
